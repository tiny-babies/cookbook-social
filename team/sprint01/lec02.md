We discussed whether we would like to do a web app or a mobile app. Based on our teams background we decided to go with a web app. It will be easier for us to work in terms of compatibility as well. We have a rough idea of the tech stack we will be working with which includes a database using firebase to store user data, and react js for the UI.
