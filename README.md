<h2> Tech Stack: </h2>

For the Front End we will be using: React JS
For the Back End, we will be using: Firebase, Express, Node JS.
We are using this tech stack due to Reactâ€™s widely supported library of components, as well as its functionality of reusing classes and components will allow us to quickly iterate during the development process. Node and Express work really well together with the React ecosystem, so we decided to use them for the server. We are using firebase because its quick and easy support with react.
